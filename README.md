Based on acpiTableExtract.pl v.1.2 - Copyright (c) 2013-2014 by Pike R. Alpha

You need UEFIExtract and iasl installed in PATH to run this app.

An other option is, to copy UEFIExtract and iasl directly to UefiTableExtract.app/Contents/MacOS

You can use install.command to do this for you automatically.
